===========

Slide'em up is a presentation tool. You write some slides in markdown, choose

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

To highlight some code in your slides, you have to install
[pygments](http://pygments.org/). Then, surround your code with backticks
like this:

    ```ruby
    class Foobar
      def baz
        puts "Foobar says baz"
      end
    end
    ```


Themes
------

Several themes are available: shower, 3d_slideshow and html5rocks.
To choose the theme for your presentation, edit the `presentation.json`
file and change the `"theme"` element.


Remote Control
--------------

When your start slide-em-up in console, a message says something like:

> Your remote key is 652df

This remote key can be used to send actions to browsers that display the
presentation. For example, this command goes to the next line:

    curl http://localhost:9000/remote/652df/next

The last part of the URL is the action and can be `next`, `prev`, `up` or
`down`.

It's also possible to force slide-em-up to use a specific remote key by
setting the `APIKEY` environment variable:

    APIKEY=foobar slide-em-up


TODO
----

* Same command line stuff than showoff
* Add a showoff theme for compatibility
* Many more themes and features
