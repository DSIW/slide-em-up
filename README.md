# Showoff

Slide'em up is a presentation tool. You write some slides in markdown, choose
a style and it displays it in HTML5. With a browser in full-screen, you can
make amazing presentations!

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3 or higher
* Sass for themes with sass files
* CoffeeScript for themes with coffee files
* Python3 for serving static presentation
* Wget for static site generation
* Pygments for syntax highlighting
* Browser for viewing presentation


## How to do your first presentation with Slide'em up?

1. Install Slideoff: `gem install slideoff`
1. Initialize your presentation under `test` directory: `slideoff init test`
1. Edit `presentation.json` and add your Flickr API key.
1. Edit `main/slides.md`
1. Serve your presentation: `slideoff serve`
1. Open your browser on http://localhost:9000/
1. Use the arrows keys to navigate between slides

## Themes

Several themes are available: `io2012`, `shower`, `3d_slideshow`, `reveal`,
`html5rocks`, `CSSS`, `memories` and `modern`. To choose the theme for your
presentation, edit the `presentation.json` file and change the `"theme"`
element.

You can also create your own theme, for example, by copying the template:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.slideoff

$EDITOR ~/.slideoff/my-theme/README
```


## Markup for the slides

    ## A subtitle ##
    And some text...

    !SLIDE
    # Another slide #

    * a
    * bullet

Many more additional elements are added. See `main/slides.md` to get an example.


## Syntax Highlighting

To highlight some code in your slides, you have to install
[pygments](http://pygments.org/). Then, surround your code with backticks
like this:

    ```ruby
    class Foobar
      def baz
        puts "Foobar says baz"
      end
    end
    ```


## Export to PDF

[phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) and then run `slideoff2pdf`.
