Slide'em up
===========

Slide'em up is a presentation tool. You write some slides in markdown, choose
a style and it displays it in HTML5. With a browser in full-screen, you can
make amazing presentations!


How to do your first presentation with Slide'em up?
---------------------------------------------------

1. Install slide-em-up: `gem install slide-em-up`
2. Create a directory for your presentation: `mkdir foobar && cd foobar`
3. Create a section for your slides: `mkdir main`
4. Write some slides: `vim main/slides.md`

       !SLIDE
       # My First slide #
       It's awesome

       !SLIDE
       # My second slide #
       This rocks too!

5. Write the `presentation.json` file with the metadata:

       {
         "title": "My first presentation",
         "theme": "CSSS",
         "duration": 20,
         "sections": {
             "main": "Title of my main section"
         }
       }

6. Launch the tool: `slide-em-up`
7. Open your browser on http://localhost:9000/
8. Use the arrows keys to navigate between the slides


Themes
------

Several themes are available: `io2012`, `shower`, `3d_slideshow`, `reveal`,
`html5rocks`, `CSSS` and `memories`. To choose the theme for your
presentation, edit the `presentation.json` file and change the `"theme"`
element.

You can also create your own theme, for example, by copying the template:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.slide-em-up
cp -r themes/template ~/.slide-em-up/my-theme
$EDITOR ~/.slide-em-up/my-theme/README
```


Markup for the slides
---------------------

This slides are writen in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
and `!SLIDE` is the indicator for a new slide.

Example:

    !SLIDE
    # Title of the first slide #
    ## A subtitle ##
    And some text...

    !SLIDE
    # Another slide #

    * a
    * bullet
    * list

    !SLIDE
    # Third slide #

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

To highlight some code in your slides, you have to install
[pygments](http://pygments.org/). Then, surround your code with backticks
like this:

    ```ruby
    class Foobar
      def baz
        puts "Foobar says baz"
      end
    end
    ```


Remote Control
--------------

When your start slide-em-up in console, a message says something like:

> Your remote key is 652df

This remote key can be used to send actions to browsers that display the
presentation. For example, this command goes to the next line:

    curl http://localhost:9000/remote/652df/next

The last part of the URL is the action and can be `next`, `prev`, `up` or
`down`.

It's also possible to force slide-em-up to use a specific remote key by
setting the `APIKEY` environment variable:

    APIKEY=foobar slide-em-up


Export to PDF
-------------

You can export your presentation to PDF by installing
[phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) and then run `slide-em-up2pdf`.


Examples
--------

I'm using slide-em-up for my own presentations, so you can find some real
slides powered by slide-em-up on https://github.com/nono/Presentations.

For example, you can try the presentation "Welcome to the nice world of Golang"
on http://blog.menfin.info/Presentations/20120709_Golang_introduction/ and
see the sources of it on
https://github.com/nono/Presentations/tree/master/20120709_Golang_introduction.
